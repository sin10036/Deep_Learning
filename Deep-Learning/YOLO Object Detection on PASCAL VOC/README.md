In this part of the assignment you will implement a YOLO-like object detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset to produce results like in the above image. The goal is to help you understand the fundamentals of training an object detector, gain experience with PyTorch as well as teaching how to use pretrained models provided by the deep learning community.
