## PROBLEM

In this assignment you will implement multi-layer neural networks on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation. Specifically, you will write your own backward pass and train two- and three-layer networks with ReLU and sigmoid nonlinearities. You will also get experience with hyperparameter tuning and using proper train/test/validation data splits
