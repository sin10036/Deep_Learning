## PROBLEM 

In this assignment you will implement simple linear classifiers on the well-known CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the fundamentals of a few classic methods and become familiar with scientific computing tools in python. You will also get experience in hyperparameter tuning and using proper train/test/validation data splits.



You will implement the following classifiers (in their respective files):

## K-nearest neighbor (KNN.py)
## Perceptron (Perceptron.py)
## SVM (SVM.py)
## Softmax (Softmax.py)
